<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	The purpse of HTML5 semantic tags is create flow and standardization across development teams. It helps everyone stay organized and helps people working with the code visualize the flow of the website. We found <section>, <nav>, and <div> to be the most useful tags.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on the page?
	It displays elements that are in order of the HTML tree within the code. For example, the header would appear before the footer.
What did you learn about Sublmine in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more snippets at a later date?
	We learned that Submlime is editable and that we can create our own snippets. We will definitely be creating them in the future for use on other projects.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The concept of snippets, specifically the tabTrigger was confusing. We can seek help in Slack and at study groups to more fully understand this concept.-->
