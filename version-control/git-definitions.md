# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that gives a developer the ability to review, change, and update code. It's useful because it allows a developer to backup their code in case they need to use an older version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is essentially a copy of your project that you can use to make changes to your code. You would use one because you don't want to constantly be updating your master and it allows multiple people on a team to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a command that updates and saves your branch and code to your git repository. A good commit message clearly states what changes have been made to the code or branch so that whoever looks at the project can easily understand what changes have been made.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two branche that you're trying to merge both changed the same part of the same file. If this happens, Git is not going to understand which file it's supposed to use and it will stop before the merge occurs.
