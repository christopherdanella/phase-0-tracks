# 9.3 jQuery

# Make a plan
* Google jQuery tutorial
* Read some articles and watch a few tutorial videos
* Bookmark useful resources and documentation
* Keep digging for new resources

Build a simple web page with HTML/CSS to use when testing new jQuery concepts.

Watching a few tutorials on YouTube was a helpful exercise to watch various jQuery tricks and tips. I was able to utilize what I saw in some of the videos within my small jQuery project. 

I bookmarked a couple of resources such as the jQuery documentation and a cheat sheet as well.
