# Release 1: Research Web Servers

2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux OS?s

The Linux OS was designed with the assumption that it's users would be computer literate and that they would know what they are doing. The prime directive of Linux is to treat all users with respect. It gives it's users complete control to do whatever they want, whether or not it's dangerous. 

3. In your own words, what is a VPS? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a virtual machine that runs it's own copy of an operating system. It allows a user to access the virtual machine and install/run any software they'd like that is compatible with that OS. Advantages of using a VPS are that it's cheaper than using a physical server, which requires much more upkeep. VPS's can be customized to suit your exact needs so you only pay for what you'd like to use. You as the user have the ability to control exactly how you'd like your VPS to run and operate. 

4. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

The root user is a super user in Linux and when you run programs on Linux as the root user and certain security devices are ignored when you are running programs as root. It's better practice to run programs on a user level and leave the root user to perform administrator tasks so that you do not do something irreversible. Hackers and viruses also know that there are root accounts and it's likely to be a target for them.
