Release 2: View a Many-to-Many Relationship

2. How do you join three tables?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

1|Three Diamond Door Bar|1|Dave|Davis|1|3|Fun atmosphere, but it gets crowded|1|1
3|Miles|4|Wyatt|Calderone|3|4|Super low key, good prices|3|4
5|Forrest Point|3|Canelo|Fritz|4|5|Good food, drinks, awesome patio!|5|3
2|The Johnsons|5|Big|Cat|5|1|Way too crowded|2|5


3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, 
reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name="The Johnsons";
